`MRG63k3a()` will generate an instance of `MRG63k3a` with initial seeds `DEFAULT_SEED63 = [ 12345, 12345, 12345, 12345, 12345, 12345 ]`

`MRG63k3a(x::Vector{Int})` will generate an instance of `MRG63k3a` with initial seeds `x`

`MRG63k3a(x::Vector{Int}, y::Vector{Int}, z::Vector{Int})` will generate an instance of `MRG63k3a` positioned at `x`, with the substream starting at `y` and the stream at `z`. All three are seeds, in the representation `get_state` returns; the state actually stored runs one step ahead of them (see below).

MRG63k3a is the 64-bit-arithmetic member of L'Ecuyer's (1999) combined MRG
family: same structure as `MRG32k3a`, moduli just under `2^63` instead
of `2^32`, period `≈ 2^377` instead of `2^191`. Its step yields just under 63
random bits, against just under 32 for MRG32k3a, so a machine word costs two
steps here and four there.

The state is stored one step ahead of the position, so that a draw returns a
pair the previous draw already computed and the processor overlaps the output
with the next state. That is internal: seeds, `get_state`, `set_state!` and
`show` all speak the same representation as MRG32k3a.
