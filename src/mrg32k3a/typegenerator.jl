# The wide unsigned types above are defined on `::Type`, which catches a direct

# array/range methods -- `rand!(rng, Vector{UInt32})` was a MethodError. Route
# those to the same implementation, so that filling an array and drawing in a
# loop give the same sequence.
#
# UInt64 used to have a second, disagreeing implementation here, assembled from
# the mantissas of two [1,2) draws. That construction assumes 52 random bits
# per double; MRG32k3a has log2(m1) = 32.0 bits of entropy per step, so the low
# mantissa bits are a near-deterministic function of the high ones. The result
# failed SmallCrush on its bit stream with six p-values at 0, and bit 12 came
# out set in two draws out of three. It is gone; `rand!` and `rand` now share
# the assembly above, at four MRG steps per UInt64 instead of two.
