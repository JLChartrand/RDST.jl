# Statistical testing of the INTEGER paths, at the bit level.
#
# The Crush batteries of TestU01 examine the 30 most significant bits of the
# U(0,1) outputs (L'Ecuyer, Nadeau-Chamard, Chen & Lebar 2021, Sec. 6), so the
# SmallCrush run in test_testu01.jl says nothing about how a generator builds a
# machine integer. For a generator whose native output *is* a word -- Philox
# 4x32, Threefry 4x32 -- that is the same stream and needs no separate test.
# For the others the integer is a construction, and a construction has to be
# tested for itself:
#
#   * MRG32k3a assembles 16-bit chunks, and MRG63k3a 32-bit chunks, of
#     z = (x1 - x2) mod m1, whose modulus is not a power of two. MRG32k3a's
#     UInt64 previously had a second implementation, built from the mantissas
#     of two [1,2) draws, which failed here with six p-values at 0 -- bit 12
#     came out set in two draws out of three -- while passing every U(0,1)
#     battery. This file is the regression net for that.
#   * The 64-bit counter-based families take the low half of a cipher word.
#   * Xoshiro256+ takes the low 32 bits of an additive scrambler, whose lowest
#     bits Blackman & Vigna document as linearly weak. SmallCrush does not
#     resolve that weakness; passing here is not a clearance for those bits.
#   * PCG takes the low 32 bits of its permuted output. For XSL-RR the rotation
#     mixes them; DXSM ends in a multiplication, whose low bits depend on fewer
#     input bits than its high ones, so both are worth their own run.
