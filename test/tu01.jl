# The TestU01 layer.
#
# Everything in this package that talks to TestU01 goes through here: the test
# suite, `scripts/testu01/validate.jl` and `scripts/testu01/replay.jl`. It calls
# the C library directly, through the same `TestU01_jll` artifact RNGTest.jl
# uses, and exists because the wrapper stopped carrying its weight:
#
#   * The battery functions return nothing. TestU01 fills `bbattery_pVal[]`,
#     `bbattery_NTests` and `bbattery_TestNames[]` with the answer and RNGTest
#     exposes none of them, so every p-value had to be read back out of the
#     formatted report -- as text, in TestU01's printing forms ("eps",
#     "1 -  3.0e-9"), which is a poor thing to classify against a threshold of
#     1e-10. Reading the globals gives the exact doubles instead.
#
#   * The test suite could not run the real battery for that reason. It drove
#     `RNGTest.smallcrushJulia`, a Julia reimplementation that keeps a subset of
#     the statistics and distributes its ten tests with `pmap` -- which under
#     `julia -p N` would serialise a copy of the generator to each worker and
#     test one stream ten times. With `bbattery_pVal[]` the C battery returns
#     its 15 statistics and the reimplementation is not needed.
#
#   * `Unif01` does not root its callback. `@cfunction($f, ...)` returns a
#     `Base.CFunction`, documented in Base as the "garbage-collection handle"
#     that must outlive every C call through the pointer; RNGTest builds it in a
#     local and drops it when the constructor returns. The callback allocates,
#     so the GC does run during a battery. It has not been seen to crash, but
#     nothing makes it safe, and a battery that dies at hour eighteen of a
#     BigCrush costs a day. `Gen` holds the handle and the closure for as long
#     as the generator lives.
#
#   * `Unif01(f::Function, name)` draws 100 values to check the return type and
#     the range before TestU01 sees the generator, so a battery over a closure
#     did not start at the stream's origin -- and each test of `smallcrushJulia`
#     paid it again, since every test built its own. The inferred return type is
#     checked here instead, which costs nothing and catches the same mistake
#     before it can segfault.
#
#   * `bbattery_Repeat*`, `Alphabit` and `Rabbit` have no wrapper at all.
#
# The layer lives under `test/` rather than beside the scripts because
# `Pkg.test()` has to be self-contained, while a script may reach anywhere in
# the checkout it belongs to.

will call into: the `Base.CFunction` trampoline and the closure behind it. Both
are fields rather than locals because the C library keeps the raw pointer and
calls it for the length of a battery — freeing the handle frees the trampoline,
and the next call from C lands in memory that is no longer ours.
