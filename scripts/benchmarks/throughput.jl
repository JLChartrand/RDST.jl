# Reproducible throughput benchmark for every generator of the package.
#
#     julia -O3 scripts/benchmarks/throughput.jl
#
# Measurement method, fixed deliberately -- naive loops give answers that differ
# by nearly a factor of two, so the method has to be stated with the numbers:
#
#   * BenchmarkTools, minimum time over the samples. The minimum is the right
#     statistic here: the work per draw is constant, so everything above the
#     minimum is interference from the rest of the machine.
#
#   * Scalar draws are accumulated with `xor` on the raw bits. An accumulator is
#     needed so the loop cannot be optimised away, and `xor` has a one-cycle
#     latency: a floating-point `+` chain has four, which is longer than a draw
#     from the fastest generators here and would measure the adder instead.
#
#   * Nothing is written to memory in the scalar loop. Storing each draw to an
#     array makes the measurement one of memory bandwidth: on this machine the
#     same xoshiro generator reads 867 M/s with an accumulator and 481 M/s
#     storing into an 8 MB vector.
#
#   * The bulk figures use `rand!` into a 4096-element vector, small enough to
#     stay in cache, so they measure generation and not the memory system.
#
# On a hybrid CPU -- Intel 12th generation and later, with performance and
# efficiency cores -- pin the process before quoting anything, or the scheduler
# will move it between core types mid-run and the minimum will come from
# whichever core happened to be fastest:
#
#     taskset -c 0 julia -O3 scripts/benchmarks/throughput.jl
#
# and say in the write-up which core type was used. A faster hybrid chip gives
# *less* trustworthy numbers than a uniform one unless this is done.
