# Why this exists. A summary report lists every p-value outside
# [0.001, 0.999], which is `gofw_Suspectp` and nothing more than a printing
# threshold: over a whole campaign a handful of those are expected from chance
# alone. The TestU01 guide draws the real line elsewhere -- "when a p-value is
# extremely close to 0 or to 1 (for example, if it is less than 1e-10), one can
# obviously conclude that the generator fails the test. If the p-value is
# suspicious but failure is not clear enough, (p = 0.0005, for example), then
# the test can be replicated independently until either failure becomes obvious
# or suspicion disappears." Everything between those two cases has to be
# replayed before it can be called anything.
#
# Two details make the replay honest rather than decorative.
#
# The output must be disjoint. `seed_words` is a fixed seed, deliberately, so
# that a run can be reproduced exactly -- which means re-running a suite the
# ordinary way reproduces the same p-values and settles nothing. `--skip`
# advances the stream generator past everything the original run consumed, so
# the replay is the independent replication the guide asks for and not the same
# arithmetic performed twice.
#
# Only the flagged tests are re-run. `bbattery_RepeatCrush(gen, rep)` applies
# test i of the battery rep[i] times and skips the rest, so resolving three
# suspects costs minutes rather than the hours the whole battery would. The
# number printed beside each suspect in a summary report is that same test
# number -- not the index of the statistic -- so it can be handed straight to
# rep. That is worth stating because a battery reports more statistics than it
# has tests (144 against 96 for Crush): several statistics can carry the same
# number, and five lines reading "10 RandomWalk1 ..." are one test, not five.

# Tests per battery, for sizing rep[]. TestU01's restriction is that rep must
# have "one more element than the number of tests in the battery": rep is
# indexed by the battery's own test numbers, which start at 1, so element 0 is
# never read. The layer keeps the table; here it is reached by the battery names
# the command line uses.
