# One-command setup for a validation campaign on a dedicated machine.
#
# The pieces this wraps -- throughput.jl, campaign.jl, the systemd unit -- each
# do one thing and are documented where they live. What was still manual is the
# order and the arithmetic: benchmark before the machine gets busy, calibrate
# before committing to a plan, size --jobs from the measured peak RSS rather
# than from nproc, and install a supervisor that survives a logout and a reboot.
#
#     ./scripts/run-campaign.sh prepare --battery=crush
#     ./scripts/run-campaign.sh start   --battery=crush
#     ./scripts/run-campaign.sh run     --battery=crush   # both of the above
#     ./scripts/run-campaign.sh status  --battery=crush
#     ./scripts/run-campaign.sh stop    --battery=crush
#     ./scripts/run-campaign.sh ensure  --battery=crush   # start only if stopped
#     ./scripts/run-campaign.sh collect --battery=crush
#
# There is no default battery, here or in campaign.jl. A stray argument must not
# be able to start a two-week BigCrush sweep.
#
# Supervisors. A systemd user unit is the best of them -- it restarts a driver
# that died and comes back after a reboot -- but it only outlives your login if
# `loginctl enable-linger` has been run for your account, which on a shared
# machine is the administrator's call. Where that is refused, --supervisor=tmux
# runs the campaign in a detached session instead, and --watchdog recovers what
# systemd was giving you:
#
#     ./scripts/run-campaign.sh run --battery=crush --supervisor=tmux --watchdog
#
#   --supervisor=auto     systemd if linger is on or can be turned on, else
#                         tmux (the default)
#   --watchdog            a user crontab entry that restarts the campaign if it
#                         is not running, and at reboot. Needs no privileges,
#                         and `stop` removes it again.
#
# Kerberos. Where the checkout or the results sit on a krb5-secured filesystem
# -- an NFS home, at most sites -- those files answer to a ticket rather than to
# your uid, and a ticket is measured in hours while a campaign is measured in
# days. `prepare` says so, and wraps the driver in krenew where it can.
